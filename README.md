# Overview
This is a simple utility I wrote that helps me get info about a server I'm on. I tend to have a lot of homelab servers running at any given time and it's hard to keep track of what server is running what hardware.

> ℹ️ **Notice:** This is for DEBIAN based systems (uses **apt**)


One line script you can copy paste to download and run the script:
```sh
wget -O system_info.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evanbuschor/server-get/main/main.sh" && chmod +x system_info.sh && ./system_info.sh
```
